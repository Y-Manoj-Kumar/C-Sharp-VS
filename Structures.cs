/*
-->Structures in C language contains only fields,whereas in CSharp structures contain  most of the members what 
   class has like  Fields,Methods,Constructors,Properties,Indexers,Operator methods etc.. 

-->Class is a reference type whereas Structure is a value type.
-->Memory allocation for instances of CLASS is performed on MANAGED Heap whereas memory allocation for 
   instances of STRUCTURES is performed on STACK.
-->We uses CLASSES[reference type] for representing LARGER usage of data whereas STRCTURES[value type] used
   for representing SMALLER usage of data. 
-->Whatever we learnt as a value type is a Structure and reference type as a Class .
-->For structures creating an instance is not mandatory even though you can get output[Mystruct struct ;]
-->In structures initialisnig a value is not possible for it's fields only decleration is possible.
-->In struct you have to define only paramterized constructor.
